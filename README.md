#  Sentiment Analysis: Nepal's Political Scenario

This project analyzes public sentiment surrounding Nepal's political landscape using machine learning and NLP techniques. We collected comments from social media platforms like **YouTube** and **Twitter** targeting major political figures before and after elections, allowing us to observe changes in public opinion over time.

## Limitations & Future Work

### Limitations
- Sarcasm and slang remain challenging to detect
- Dataset imbalance in political texts
- Dependency on pretrained models not optimized for local political context
